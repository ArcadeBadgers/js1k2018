# pollute

Move mouse to move ship. Fire out front, waste out back. Avoid and shoot the waste!

Pollution slowly gets bigger over time, and colliding with it will end the game.
Moving slower will stop the ship from polluting but also slows down rate of fire.

No win condition, just got as long as you can! Score is displayed on the top left.
